# DATA COLLECTION AND ENTRY

By carefully planning and standardizing the data collection and entry process, you can ensure that the dataset is well-structured, consistent, and ready for efficient analysis. This approach minimizes data cleaning and preprocessing work later in the research process.

## Structured Data Collection

   * Alignment with Tidy Data Principles: Ensure that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.
   * Designing Data Collection Methods:
      * Surveys:
        * Design surveys with clearly defined questions that correspond to individual variables.
         * Use consistent question formats to facilitate easy data entry and analysis.
         * For multiple-choice questions, pre-define the categories and ensure they are mutually exclusive.
     * Experiments:
       * Plan experiments by defining variables and measurements clearly.
         * Ensure that data collection is systematic; for instance, if collecting time series data, measurements should be taken at regular intervals.
         * Record metadata (data about data) like experimental conditions, date and time of experiments, and instrument settings.
   * Data Collection Tools:
      * Use digital tools for automated data collection where possible (e.g., online survey platforms, data logging software).
     * Ensure these tools are configured to output data in a structured, tidy format.

## Data Entry Format

  * Consistency in Data Formats:
    * Choose a uniform format for your entire dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel).
      * If multiple formats are necessary, plan for data integration and standardization at later stages.
* Standardizing Data Types and Formats:
  * Date Formats: Choose a standard date format (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD) and use it consistently across your dataset.
    * Numeric Formats: Decide on decimal places, units (if applicable), and consistently use them.
      * Text Data: Standardize text data, like ensuring consistent use of uppercase and lowercase.
  * Categorical Data:
    * Define categories clearly and ensure they are exhaustive and mutually exclusive.
      * For ordinal data (data with a specific order), ensure the order is consistent and logical.
  * Use of Templates and Forms:
    * Create data entry templates or forms to guide consistent data entry.
      * Templates should include fields for all variables with dropdown menus for categorical variables to minimize entry errors.

## Quality Control and Validation

  * Implement checks to validate data entry (e.g., range checks for numerical data, format checks for dates).
* Regularly review data entries for errors or inconsistencies.

## Training and Guidelines

  * Provide training for all individuals involved in data collection and entry.
* Develop a comprehensive guideline document detailing data collection and entry standards.
