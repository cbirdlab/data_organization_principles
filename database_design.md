# DATABASE DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION

1. Understand Basic Database Concepts

    * _Database_: A structured collection of data.
    * _Table_: A set of data elements (values) that is organized using a model of vertical columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows.
    * _Column_: A set of data values of a particular type, one for each row of the table.
    * _Row_: A single, implicitly structured data item in a table. 

2. Choose the Right Database Type

    * _Relational Database_: A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. It's based on the relational model of data, which organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Best for structured data with relationships. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL.
      * _Tables_: Data is organized in tables.
      * _Rows and Columns_: Each row is a record with a unique ID, and each column is a feature of the record.
      * _Relations_: Tables can be linked to each other through foreign keys.

    * _NoSQL Database_: Suitable for unstructured data or when scalability and flexibility are priorities. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra.

3. Design the Database Schema

    * _Understand Normalization_: It's the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency. Normalization is done through a series of steps called normal forms.
    * _First Normal Form (1NF)_: Each column should hold atomic values, and there should be no repeating groups.
      * _Requirement_: All entries in a column (field) must be of the same data type and each column must contain atomic values only.
      * _Atomic values_: In the context of databases, an atomic value is one that cannot be divided. It's the simplest and indivisible type of data value that can be represented in a database column.
         * _Example_: Consider a column for phone numbers. Each entry in this column should be a single, complete phone number. Splitting a phone number into multiple columns (e.g., country code, area code, number) would mean it's no longer atomic in this context. Alternatively, having multiple phone numbers in the same row and column would also not be atomic because it can be divided into multiple phone numbers.
      * _Objective_: Eliminate duplicative columns and create separate tables for each group of related data.
    * _Second Normal Form (2NF)_: Meet all requirements of 1NF, and there should be no partial dependency of any column on the primary key.
      * _Requirement_: Being in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
      * _Objective_: Ensure that each attribute is dependent on the whole key, thus avoiding partial dependency.
    * _Third Normal Form (3NF)_: Meet all requirements of 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.
      * _Requirement_: Being in 2NF and no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.
      * _Objective_: Ensure that attributes do not depend on non-key attributes. Every non-prime attribute must depend directly on the primary key.
        
4. Implement ACID Properties

   It's important to understand the definition of a transaction in the context of a database.  A transaction in a database system symbolizes a unit of work performed within a database management system against a database, and treated in a coherent and reliable way independent of other transactions. e.g. A bank transfer operation from one account to another involves multiple steps (debit from one account, credit to another). All these steps collectively form a transaction. In the context of our lab, a transaction might be the logging of a single sampling event on a particular date at a particular time.  

    * _Atomicity_: Each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds completely or fails completely.
    * _Consistency_: Transactions should transform the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining data integrity.
    * _Isolation_: Transactions are performed independently and transparently.
    * _Durability_: Once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

6. Define Data Types and Constraints

    * _Data Types_: Choose appropriate data types for each column (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE).
    * _Constraints_: Define rules to maintain data integrity (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE).
       * _Definition_: Constraints in a database are rules or limits that define the way data can be inserted, updated, or deleted from tables. They are used to maintain the accuracy and integrity of the data.
       * Types:
          * Primary Key: A column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
          * Foreign Key: A column that establishes a relationship between two tables by connecting a row to a primary key in another table
          * Unique: Ensures that all values in a column are different.
          * Not Null: Ensures that a column cannot have a NULL value.
          * Check: Ensures that all values in a column satisfy a specific condition.

7. Diagram for Better Understanding

   Creating a simple Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) can help visualize the database structure. An ERD illustrates the relationships between entities (tables) in a database. Let's create a basic ERD for a hypothetical student database:

    * Entities (Tables): Students, Courses, Enrollments.
    * Relationships:
        A student can enroll in many courses.
        A course can have many students.

7. Tools and Software

    Use database design tools (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBDesigner) for creating schemas and ERDs.
    Practice with sample databases to understand the implementation of these principles.
