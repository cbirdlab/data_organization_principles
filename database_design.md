# DATABASE DESIGN & IMPLEMENTATION

1. Understand Basic Database Concepts

    * _Database_: A structured collection of data.
    * _Table_: A set of data elements (values) that is organized using a model of vertical columns (which are identified by their name) and horizontal rows.
    * _Column_: A set of data values of a particular type, one for each row of the table.
    * _Row_: A single, implicitly structured data item in a table. 

2. Choose the Right Database Type

    * _Relational Database_: A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. It's based on the relational model of data, which organizes data into one or more tables (or "relations") of columns and rows, with a unique key identifying each row. Best for structured data with relationships. Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL.
      * Tables: Data is organized in tables.
      * Rows and Columns: Each row is a record with a unique ID, and each column is a feature of the record.
      * Relations: Tables can be linked to each other through foreign keys.

    * _NoSQL Database_: Suitable for unstructured data or when scalability and flexibility are priorities. Examples include MongoDB, Cassandra.

3. Design the Database Schema

    * _Understand Normalization_: It's the process of organizing data to minimize redundancy and dependency. Normalization is done through a series of steps called normal forms.
    * _First Normal Form (1NF)_: Each column should hold atomic values, and there should be no repeating groups.
      * Requirement: All entries in a column (field) must be of the same data type and each column must contain atomic values only.
      * Objective: Eliminate duplicative columns and create separate tables for each group of related data.
    * _Second Normal Form (2NF)_: Meet all requirements of 1NF, and there should be no partial dependency of any column on the primary key.
      * Requirement: Being in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
      * Objective: Ensure that each attribute is dependent on the whole key, thus avoiding partial dependency.
    * _Third Normal Form (3NF)_: Meet all requirements of 2NF, and there should be no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.
      * Requirement: Being in 2NF and no transitive dependency for non-prime attributes.
      * Objective: Ensure that attributes do not depend on non-key attributes. Every non-prime attribute must depend directly on the primary key.
        
4. Implement ACID Properties

    * _Atomicity_: Each transaction is treated as a single unit, which either succeeds completely or fails completely.
    * _Consistency_: Transactions should transform the database from one valid state to another valid state, maintaining data integrity.
    * _Isolation_: Transactions are performed independently and transparently.
    * _Durability_: Once a transaction is committed, it remains so, even in the event of a system failure.

5. Define Data Types and Constraints

    * _Data Types_: Choose appropriate data types for each column (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE).
    * _Constraints_: Define rules to maintain data integrity (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, NOT NULL, UNIQUE).

6. Diagram for Better Understanding

Creating a simple Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) can help visualize the database structure. An ERD illustrates the relationships between entities (tables) in a database. Let's create a basic ERD for a hypothetical student database:

    Entities (Tables): Students, Courses, Enrollments.
    Relationships:
        A student can enroll in many courses.
        A course can have many students.

7. Tools and Software

    Use database design tools (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBDesigner) for creating schemas and ERDs.
    Practice with sample databases to understand the implementation of these principles.
